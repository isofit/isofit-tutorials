Project Support 
============

The ISOFIT codebase was made possible with support from various sources.
The initial algorithm and code was developed by the NASA Earth Science
Division data analysis program “Utilization of Airborne Visible/Infrared
Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation Data from an Airborne Campaign in
India," program NNH16ZDA001N-AVRSNG, managed by Woody Turner.  

Later research and maturation was provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and
California Institute of Technology President and Director’s Fund, and the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Research and Technology Development Program.
The project is currently supported by the Open Source Tools, Frameworks,
and Libraries Program (NNH20ZDA001N), managed by Dr. Steven Crawford.

Neural network radiative transfer is supported by the NASA Center
Innovation Fund managed in conjunction with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Office of the Chief Scientist and Technologist. 

The initial research took place at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,
4800 Oak Grove Dr., Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.
