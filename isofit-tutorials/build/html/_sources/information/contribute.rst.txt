Contributing
============

We hope that these tutorials can be a community repository of software examples for 
atmospheric and surface corrections using the ISOFIT software. If new functionality is added to the codebase, 
it can be accompanied by notebook-style code examples.

Examples of potential contributions include:

* Tutorials for existing and new ISOFIT functionality
* Examples of ISOFIT running on various supported instruments

Please feel free to draft notebooks, contact the maintainers, and open pull requests.
If you have have discovered an issue or desire a missing feature, please create a `new
issue <https://github.com/isofit/isofit-tutorials/issues/new>`_.

The primary ISOFIT documentation `describes in detail <https://isofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom/CONTRIBUTING.html>`_ how to begin contributing.

We use `nbsphinx <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.7/>`_ to display jupyter notebook examples on the readthedocs page. Contributed examples can be written, and hosted simply as an .ipynb file. 
Notebook codes are executed locally and jupyter cell outputs are saved as image hashes, which are then viewable on the static html page. 

The current notebook directory structure is subject to change as more examples are added. Place your example in the source folder under the most appropriate directory. We can always iterate through the PR process.
